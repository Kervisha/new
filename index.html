<u>
About Me
</u>
</strong>

<p> Hi, I'm Kervisha Cordice a writer, author, singer/songwriter and visual artist. 
<br>My work is centered around my life as well as the lives of those I encounter thus 
<br>often reflecting the human experience, mental health, and spirituality.
</p>

<p>I graduated from The University of the West Indies in 2019 with a BA in Literatures in English 
<br>and Linguistics as a Double Major. A major I chose by closing my eyes, tapping and hoping for the best.
<br>Now I'm an MEd student *fingers crossed*.
</p>

<p>I was published in the IGDS 2018 Gender Studies journal where they featured my spoken-word poem, "Never
<br>Asking for It." However, my first book was a self-published collection of pictures, poems, and short stories
<br>entitled, "Sunrise on the Quadrangle." If you're interested in having a reading some of my work, you should
<br> check out the "Writings" section of the site. If you do, I hope you enjoy it.
</p>

<p>All I really want from my body of work is to know that it leaves just one person feeling less alone in their 
<br>human experience, that is my motivation to create. 
</p>

<p>Thank you for reading. 
<br>Stay Groovy.
